# PrimeShuffleCrypto

Crypt every file using a key of 1 Mio. bits.

No backdoors, it's Perl!

You can try, its running!

But don't forgot the password used for crypting.

You cannot encrypt without it and nobody can help you in this case.

Also not the NSA!

You can just try some passwords.

=========================================================================

   Thats an important feature of this encryption tool!
   
   If you run in trouble, just delete one of the keys by wipeout.

   All is unreadable for all times!
